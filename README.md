# HTV-API-Workshop
The main repository for the "Introduction to APIs: Google Cloud" workshop at Hack The Valley 4

# Introduction
This workshop is aimed towards getting you familiar with what APIs are and how to use them. In this workshop, we will learn what an API is, what they are used for, and how we can use them in our own projects. We will work towards a simple python application that connects to Google Cloud Platform's Places API and obtains information about different places!

# Prerequisites
- A python IDE (I personally reccomend PyCharm from JetBrains (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (If you are a student, you can get all jetbrains products for free!)
- A Google Cloud Platform account (You can sign up for free, and you will receive $300 credit on your first sign up, https://cloud.google.com/free)
- Stable internet connection (Get on eduroam if you aren't already on it)
