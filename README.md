# HTV-API-Workshop
The main repository for the "Introduction to APIs: Google Cloud" workshop at Hack The Valley 4

# Introduction
This workshop is aimed towards getting you familiar with what APIs are and how to use them. In this workshop, we will learn what an API is, what they are used for, and how we can use them in our own projects. We will work towards a simple python application that connects to Google Cloud Platform's Places API and obtains information about different places!

# Prerequisites
- A python IDE (I personally reccomend PyCharm from JetBrains (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (If you are a student, you can get all jetbrains products for free!)
- A Google Cloud Platform account (You can sign up for free, and you will receive $300 credit on your first sign up, https://cloud.google.com/free)
- Stable internet connection (Get on eduroam if you aren't already on it)
- A very basic knowledge of Git (If not, no worries, I'll go over what you need during the workshop)

# Workshop Structure
As you probably see, I have booked a 2 hour time slot for this workshop, but we will definitely not be using the entire two hours. My plan is to teach for 45 minutes to an hour, and then for the remaining time, the room will be a workshop room where you can ask me (or other mentors present) questions about what we did in the workshop, how to apply what we learned, or even other questions that you deem fit! You are also free to leave at any time during the workshop if I'm boring you to death or you have other committments.

The actual content of the workshop is split into multiple parts, <b>each of the different parts are in their own git branch!</b> You can switch between the parts by simply switching the branch in the web UI, or by typing git checkout <branch name> in your command line. I will call out what parts we are on during the workshop and make sure everybody is following along so you do not need to worry too much about knowing when to switch branches in the actual workshop. You can also click one of the links below to switch to that specific part:
