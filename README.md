# Part 1
This section will aim to give you an understanding of what APIs are and why we use them.

# What is an API?
An API is a means for a company, organization, or individual to make their data or functions/features accessible and integratable for a large amount of developers without the need for the developer themself to put in a large amount of overhead work. For an example, the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap API</a> provides developers with a way to access on-demand and reliable weather data for locations all across the world without the developer needing to do any work in the collection of that data. They simply make a quick request to the API and they will get data back instantly.
